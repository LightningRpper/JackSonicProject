# JackSonicProject
A Sonic fangame currently in the works. Been using this to learn about GameMaker an game development in general.

Currently I have everything programmed for Sonic that I want to program (running, Spin Dash, Boost, Light Speed Dash, Stomp, and the Homing Attack) (Although the Homing Attack still does have a few kinks). I also have speed boosters, dash rings, the various collectible rings, loops, and swing bars coded in as well. My priority as of right now is perfecting Sonic's playstyle before moving onto Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Blaze before moving to things like enemy behavior, levels, and bosses.
