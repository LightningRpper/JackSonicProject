# JackSonicProject
A Sonic fangame currently in the works. Been using this to learn about GameMaker an game development in general.

Currently I have everything programmed for Sonic that I want to program (running, Spin Dash, Boost, Light Speed Dash, Stomp) except the Homing Attack. I also have speed boosters, dash rings, the various collectible rings, and loops coded in as well. My priority as of right now is perfecting Sonic's playstyle before moving onto Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Blaze before moving to things like enemy behavior, levels, and bosses.
